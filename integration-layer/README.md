# Integration Layer

## Overview

The Integration Layer is the bridge between the Infrastructure/Backend and the Internal Wargames Logic branches. It ensures that the game logic can effectively utilize the infrastructure services, facilitating communication, synchronization, and security enforcement.

## Components

1. **State Synchronization**
   - **SyncManager**: Ensures that the game logic is synchronized with the distributed state management system, propagating state changes and ensuring consistency.

2. **Event Handling and Notification**
   - **EventBridge**: Manages the communication of events between the game logic and event management system, ensuring that events are correctly propagated and processed.

3. **Security Interface**
   - **SecurityBridge**: Interfaces between the game logic and security systems, enforcing access control and transaction authentication.

4. **Analytics Integration**
   - **AnalyticsBridge**: Connects the game logic with the real-time analytics system, gathering data for monitoring and performance analysis.

## Purpose

The Integration Layer ensures that the core game logic can fully leverage the infrastructure services without being directly tied to them. This separation of concerns allows for more modular development and easier maintenance.
